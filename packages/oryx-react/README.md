# `@contextualai/oryx-react`

Oryx React is a headless, composable UI component library for integrating Contextual AI agents into your React applications.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @contextualai/oryx-react

# Optional:
# npm install @microsoft/fetch-event-source
```

> GET request also works as long as it is proxied into POST request when sending to Contextual AI's API, but it has limitation on the search params length. Therefore, it is recommended to start SSE connection using a POST request, which is supported by `@microsoft/
fetch-event-source`.
