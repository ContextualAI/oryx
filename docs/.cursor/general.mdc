## For commands

- For pnpm commands like `pnpm build` in `docs` directory, you always need to run it with all permissions (especially network permission).

## For writing MDX contents

- Keep heading structure flatten. Only use `#` for headings. Do not use more nested levels like `##` or `###`.
- Use bold conservatively. Do not use italic.
- Do not use the en dash (`–`); prefer the em dash (`—`) instead. When using an em dash, always include a space before and after it (e.g. `vital — whether`, not `vital—whether`).
- MDX docs content should be extremely concise. Only keep necessary sentences, and don't keep boring / redundant / repetitive contents. Be very straightforward and crisp.
