# Oryx

Oryx is a native UI integration library for [Contextual AI](https://contextual.ai) agents, built to bring agent experiences directly into your product. It handles the connection, logic, and data flow, so you can focus purely on your design and user experience.

- **Fully unstyled** — ready to adapt to any branding, design system, or CSS framework.
- **Fully composable** — seamlessly integrate with your own UI components.
- **Battery included** — built-in proxy enforces best engineering and security practices.
- **Best developer experience** — built by our top engineers, with best practices.

The Oryx library includes two packages:

- `@contextualai/oryx-react` — Unbranded React primitives for building agent UI.
- `@contextualai/oryx-proxy-node` — Node.js proxy for proxying API requests.
